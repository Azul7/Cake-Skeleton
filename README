This is a bare repo of CakePHP 1.2.5.

It is intended as a base for multiple applications.

There is a skel that includes many useful helpers to bake projects from.

------------------------------------------------------------
$ cake bake project -skel vendors/shells/templates/skel
------------------------------------------------------------

To run the schema, you will need to change the class name in config/sql/schema.php to match your application directory.
If your directory is titled 'awesome', your schema should read 

<?php
class AwesomeSchema extends CakeSchema { ... }
?>
